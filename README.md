# Web Template #

This is a personal template to start a new front-end project and also for learning purpose.

A development version (without a server) that watches changes can be started
with `npm start`. To build the project into the "dist" folder run `npm run build`.
The project can be deployed with `npm run deploy` but first needs SSH configuration
in "gulpfile.js".
